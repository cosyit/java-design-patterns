# Introduction

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.
设计模式是程序员在设计应用程序或系统时可以用来解决常见问题的最佳形式化实践。

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.
设计模式可以通过提供经过测试的，经过验证的开发范例来加快开发过程。

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.
重用设计模式有助于防止引起重大问题的细微问题，并且还可以提高熟悉模式的编码人员和架构师的代码可读性。

# Getting started

This site showcases Java Design Patterns. The solutions have been developed by
experienced programmers and architects from the open source community. The 
patterns can be browsed by their high level descriptions or by looking at their
source code. The source code examples are well commented and can be thought as
programming tutorials how to implement a specific pattern. We use the most
popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.
该站点展示了Java设计模式。该解决方案是由开源社区中经验丰富的程序员和架构师开发的。
可以通过高级描述或查看其源代码来浏览这些模式。源代码示例得到了很好的注释，可以看作是如何实施特定模式的编程教程。
我们使用最流行的经过验证的开源Java技术。

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
software design principles.
在深入学习本文之前，您应该熟悉各种软件设计原则。

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.

Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
patterns by any of the following approaches
所有设计应尽可能简单。您应该从KISS，YAGNI和“可能可行的最简单的事情”原则入手。
仅在实际可扩展性需要它们时才应引入复杂性和模式。

 - Using difficulty tags, `Difficulty-Beginner`, `Difficulty-Intermediate` & `Difficulty-Expert`.
 - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral`, and others.
 - Search for a specific pattern. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern [here](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/issues).

Hopefully you find the object oriented solutions presented on this site useful
in your architectures and have as much fun learning them as we had developing them.
